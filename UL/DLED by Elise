What an awesome prime minister we have got,
You cannot prevail at last,
Thus, they might have not heard about it befou,
Yea, dad is great--having that little song in your head keeps you warm
My name is Elise Knuuti
I am the only swede who knows that deep fear is profession
They are wicked on Flashback.org;
You cannot prevail at last,
Whatever happened to that lady is a story in its own
